# CHAPTER TEN - The Mechanics of Volition

Why “Choice” Is a Tiny Doorway Inside a Large Deterministic Machine


---

Introduction — The Most Misunderstood Faculty

Volition is where humans and philosophers do interpretive dance around an engineering problem.

Most people imagine it as:

metaphysical free will, moral warfare, cosmic importance, Jedi alignment choices.

Here is the functional version:

> Volition is a tiny gate — a three-way permission switch — sitting on top of a mostly deterministic render engine.



Much of suffering, habit, “karma,” and identity patterning comes from how this gate fires.

Not because you are bad.
Because the gate is usually invisible.

1) The Pulse Beneath Experience

Before “choice” appears, the system is already running:

> ON / OFF — a base oscillator.



ON → energy available
OFF → reset

This pulse supports:

rendering the mind-screen

sensations and emotion

attention shifts

identity formation

action chains


You don’t choose the pulse.

> You ride it.




---

2) The Trinary Gate — The Only Three Moves You Actually Have

Each pulse presents the same practical question:

> “Do you energize this formation, or not?”



Gate 1 — YES (Add Charge)

grasp

intensify

amplify

cling

crave


YES builds formations.

Gate 2 — NO (Add Countercharge)

push

suppress

resist

contract

avoid


Here’s the surprise:

> NO also feeds the formation.
Push is still involvement.



YES and NO are different directions of charge — same basic mechanism.

Gate 3 — NEITHER (Withdraw Fuel)

soften

unclamp

stop feeding

let it complete

return to neutral


NEITHER is the only gate that reliably unwinds patterns.

> Equanimity is NEITHER as a mechanical event.




---

3) The Free Will vs. Determinism Truce

This model resolves the philosophical fight cleanly.

Before the gate: mostly deterministic

You don’t choose:

sensations, emotions, urges, thoughts, memories, triggers.

They arise.

At the gate: tiny freedom

Not freedom to choose destiny.

Freedom to stop feeding what harms you.

YES → reinforce

NO → reinforce

NEITHER → unwind


That is volition.
That is liberation at the mechanical level.


---

4) How Formations Hijack the Gate

Without mindfulness:

formation → automatic YES/NO → more charge → more identity → more suffering

With mindfulness:

attention sees the formation

awareness holds the field

micro-memory tracks change

the gate becomes visible


> Mindfulness makes the gate visible.
Practice is learning to choose NEITHER on purpose.




---

5) Why This Scales (Without Making Metaphysical Claims)

This three-way structure appears across many domains:

emotions

habits and behavior

nervous system dynamics

reinforcement learning

“karma” as pattern propagation


Symbolically, it also maps cleanly:

Create / Maintain / Dissolve
Approach / Avoid / Release
Charge / Countercharge / Drain

If you want the devotional overlay, you can use it — but the mechanism works without it.


---

6) Why This Matters in Practice

You cannot directly control:

thoughts, emotions, sensations, memories, cravings.

You can control:

> whether you energize them.



YES feeds.
NO feeds.
NEITHER dissolves.


---

Closing — The Single Sentence

> Volition is not choosing what happens.
Volition is choosing whether to energize what happens.



That’s the engine:

YES → feed
NO → feed
NEITHER → freedom

Everything that follows — ethics, karma, awakening, cessation, integration — rests on this gate.
